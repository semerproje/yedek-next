# Security Fix Notes

## Quill XSS Vulnerability Fix

The project has a moderate security vulnerability in the quill package used by react-quill.

### Issue:
- Cross-site Scripting in quill <=1.3.7
- Affects react-quill >=0.0.3

### Recommended Fix:
```bash
npm audit fix --force
```

Note: This will install react-quill@0.0.2 which is a breaking change.

### Alternative Solutions:
1. Update to a newer quill version if available
2. Consider switching to a different rich text editor
3. Implement additional XSS protection measures

### Impact:
- Medium severity vulnerability
- Potential XSS attacks through rich text editor
